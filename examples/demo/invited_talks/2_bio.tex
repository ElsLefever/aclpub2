Before joining Microsoft, Rich was on the faculty in Computer Science at Cornell, at UCLA’s Medical
School, and at CMU’s Center for Learning and Discovery. Rich’s Ph.D. is from CMU. His work on
Multitask Learning helped create interest in a subfield of machine learning called Transfer Learning.
Rich received an NSF CAREER Award in 2004 (for Meta Clustering), best paper awards in 2005 (with
Alex Niculescu-Mizil), 2007 (with Daria Sorokina), and 2014 (with Todd Kulesza, Saleema Amershi,
