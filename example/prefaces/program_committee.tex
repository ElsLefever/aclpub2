Welcome to EMNLP 2020!\\

Due to the unprecedented situation with the Covid-19 pandemic, EMNLP 2020 will be held completely
online this year. We decided to move EMNLP to a virtual format early on, when the pandemic just
started, and postponed the paper submission deadlines by three weeks such that authors affected by the
pandemic could have more time for their paper submissions. This resulted in a much tighter schedule
for paper review and decisions, as well as publications, workshop programs, virtual infrastructure, etc.
However, thanks to everyoneâ€™s hard work, we made it.
We received a record number of 3,677 submissions. This is a significant increase of 26% over EMNLP
2019, making it the largest NLP conference to date in terms of paper submissions. After removing

or double submission policy, 3,359 submissions were sent out for review. Despite the sharp increase in
submissions, we kept the acceptance rates at a similar level as past years. The acceptance statistics are
