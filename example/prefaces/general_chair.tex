Like my colleague, Dan Jurafsky, General Chair of ACL-2020, the first ACL conference to be hit by the
virus that has up-ended our world, I am sitting at my laptop, in the same chair I have sat in since March
2020, to welcome you to EMNLP-2020. It is also where I am likely to be sitting for EMNLP-2020 itself.
